## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
heights<-c(140,145,143,122)
```


```{r}

is.numeric(heights)
```
```{r}
is.character(heights)
```

```{r}
BP<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\jsang\\Downloads\\BP.csv")
```

```{r}
attach(BP)
```

```{r}
plot(SBP,DBP,main = "BP Data", sub = "Investigating relationship between numerical variables, SBP and DBP",xlab = "SBP", ylab = "DBP", col="Purple", pch=9)
```


##Histograms!

```{r}
#Histograms give us information about the general 'shape' of our data, ie. is it approximately normally distributed? Does it contain any potential outliers?
Blowflies<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\jsang\\Downloads\\BLOWFLIES.csv")

```

```{r}
attach(Blowflies)
```

```{r}
names(Blowflies)
```
```{r}
hist(number_emerging, col = "Maroon", main = "Histogram of blowfly emergence",xlab = "number_emerging")
```


#Stem - leaf plots

```{r}
stem(number_emerging)
```













#PROBLEM SET 2, HW 2 - GRAPHICS AND BASIC STATISTICS



#QN 1 
# Do the telomeres of parents/caregivers of very sick children also shorten as a result of chronic stress, perhaps, as they spend more time looking after sick children? 




#STEP 1: Dowload the data, read in, and attach

```{r}
Telomeres<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\jsang\\Downloads\\TELOMERES(1).csv")
```


```{r}
attach(Telomeres)
```


```{r}
#check column names in my data frame
colnames(Telomeres)
```

#STEP 2: Identify the type of variable, categorical or numerical?

#(Do i need to check colname or the data itself- telomeres????????????????????)

```{r}
is.numeric(years)
#The variable, "years" is of numeric type!
```
```{r}
is.numeric(telomere.length)
#The variable, "telomere" is also of numeric type!
```
```{r}
is.vector(years)

#It is  vector
```
```{r}
is.vector(telomere.length)
#It is also vector
```



```{r}
is.character(years)
#Variable "years" not of character type
```
```{r}
is.character(telomere.length)
#variable, "telomere" is also not of character type!
```






```{r}
#Check type of data
is.data.frame(Telomeres)
#True, thus data is a data frame
```

##For this question, we need a scatterplot to investigate that relationship



```{r}
#Plot a scatterplot!
#x-axis is the years and y-axis is the telomere length

plot(years,telomere.length, main = "Telomeres data", sub = "Investigating relationship between the length of telomeres and time(in years)", xlab = "years", ylab = "telomere.length", col="purple", pch=7)
# adding a black line of best fit through the scatterplot
abline(lm(telomere.length~years),col="Black")

# From the look of the line of best fit, we can deduce that telomere length and time are inversely related.

#Therefore, yes,it is likely that the telomeres of parents/caregivers of very sick children  shorten as a result of chronic stress, perhaps, as they spend more time looking after sick children.


```


#QUESTION 2: Improve the scatterplot you produced from the hippocampus

```{r}
 hippocampus<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\jsang\\Downloads\\hippocampus_218P.csv")
```

```{r}
attach(hippocampus)
```

```{r}
names(hippocampus)
```
```{r}
plot(posterior_hippo_vol, months_as_taxi_driver, main = "Hippocampus data", sub = "Relationship between volume of the posterior hippocampus in taxi drivers and months as a taxi diver", xlab = "posterior_hippo_vol", ylab = "months_as_taxi_driver" ,col="red", pch=4)

```



#QUESTION 3: 


#3.1  Create a graph depicting the frequency distribution of the 35 mass measurements. 



```{r}
#Read in the data and store in a new vector called mass, usng c() function
 #measurements of spermatophore mass (in mg) of 35 males:  
mass<-c(0.047, 0.037, 0.041, 0.045, 0.039, 0.064, 0.064, 0.065, 0.079, 0.070, 0.066, 0.059, 0.075, 0.079, 0.090, 0.069, 0.066, 0.078, 0.066, 0.066, 0.055, 0.046, 0.056, 0.067, 0.075, 0.048, 0.077, 0.081, 0.066, 0.172, 0.080, 0.078, 0.048, 0.096, 0.097)


```



```{r}
#Use the table() function to build a contingency table of the counts at each combination of factor levels.
#Now we can see the frequencies for each
#http://metadatascience.com/2013/07/03/plotting-the-frequency-distribution-using-r/
table(mass)
```


#WHEN DO WE USE barplot(mass)???????


```{r}
#use barplot() and table() function to plot the graph
#https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/bar-plot/
#add title, color, and label axis

barplot(table(mass), main = "spermatophore mass (in mg) of 35 males", xlab = "spermatophore mass (in mg)", ylab = "count", col="maroon", border ="blue")
```





#3.2 Describe the shape of the frequency distribution. What are its main features? (Hint: are there any outliers?). 


```{r}
#There is one big outlier, spermatophore of 0.066 mg. Its has a very big count number compared to the other masses. 
#We can also say most of the masses have a frequency of 1
#The shape is symmetric and bell shaped

```



##Error in detach(Blowflies) : invalid 'name' argument???????????????

```{r}
#detach files


detach(BP)
detach(Blowflies)
detach(hippocampus)
detach(Telomeres)
