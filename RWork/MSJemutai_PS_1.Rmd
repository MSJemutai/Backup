## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




##PROBLEM SET 1, HW 1

##QUESTION 1 (A)

```{r}
#Load data from the graduate school at Berkely
UCBAdmissions

```


```{r}
#confirm the data set is categorical, Table data set
#We cannot attach (works for lists, data frames, and environments only)
class(UCBAdmissions)
```

```{r}
#Checking dimensions in the data set and how they classified
#The applicants are classified by gender, admit, and department
#There data forms a 3-way table!

str(UCBAdmissions)
```

```{r}
# how many males versus females are in the set (use margin.table()function)
#2, is for Gender!
#https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/308591_6dff566d383946c881cb5b6a735a79fd.html
margin.table(UCBAdmissions, 2)


```
```{r}
# how many of them were admitted overall 
#Admit - 1
#Also shows those rejected in total
margin.table(UCBAdmissions, 1)
```

```{r}
#how many were admitted to each of the departments
#Also shows total of those rejected by each department
margin.table(UCBAdmissions, c(1,3))
```

```{r}

#Let's find proportion of men admitted in each department vs women

round(prop.table(UCBAdmissions,1),2)
# There seems to be a balance between number of departments that admitted more male and those that did not. 
```

```{r}
#Let's use a frequency table
ftable(round(prop.table(UCBAdmissions, c(2,3)), 2),
       row.vars="Dept", col.vars = c("Gender", "Admit"))
#Only 2 departments seem to have high proportion of men admitted than women

```
```{r}
#let's compare proportion of men and women applying to each department against admissions 
round(prop.table(margin.table(UCBAdmissions,c(2,3)),1),2)

```

```{r}
#http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~athienit/STA6505/ucbadmissions.pdf
round(prop.table(margin.table(UCBAdmissions,c(1,3)),2),2)
#From the two, we can see that women seem to tend to apply to deparments with low admission rates
```
##QUESTION 1(B) 

```{r}
#Mosaic plot for gender against admission
mosaicplot(~Gender+Admit, data=UCBAdmissions, col=c("Lime Green","Purple"))

#From the plot, among the admitted applicnts, most are male!
#The plot does not seem to clearly show which gender forms the highest group among those rejected though***


```

```{r}
#Let's plot another mosaic plot 
#chance of being accepted vs the department?
mosaicplot(apply(UCBAdmissions, c(3,1), sum),col=c("Yellow","Blue"))
#Compare with the next plot
```
```{r}
#Let's check gender against admission
#mosaicplot(apply(Titanic, c(3,2)),col=c("Pink","Gold"))
mosaicplot(~Dept+Gender, data=UCBAdmissions, col=c("Orange","Red"))
##From the last 2 plots, we can see that less women apply to departments that admit more peple!

```
##QUESTION 2

```{r}
#Download the file, read it into RStudio and plot either the anterior or 
#Read in the file
hippocampus<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\jsang\\Downloads\\hippocampus_218P.csv")

```


```{r}
#let's check names of columns
names(hippocampus)
```

```{r}
#attach it so you can call each column by name
attach(hippocampus)
```

```{r}
#Plot the posterior hippocampus column against the months as a taxi diver column in a scatterplot

plot(posterior_hippo_vol,months_as_taxi_driver)
```

```{r}
#Detach!!
detach(hippocampus)

```
